# Upgrade instructions from version 5.0.0 to version 5.1.0 Commercio Network Chain Mainnet

## Prerequisites


1. Have a working node in **mainnet** with software version v5.0.0.
2. Have all the tools on the server to compile the application as mentioned in the first paragraph at [Installing the software requirements](https://docs.commercio.network/nodes/full-node-installation.html#_1-installing-the-software-requirements)


## Recommendations

1. To perform the update quickly and make it easy, use `cosmovisor` tools


**Please note**: this upgrade is **MANDATORY**. The nodes that will not upgrade will become incompatible with the chain and they will stop.

**Please note**: if you install a new node do it with the [statesync procedure](https://docs.commercio.network/nodes/statesync-node-installation.html).

## Upgrade info

This upgrade will be performed with a proposal. The proposals are shown here

https://mainnet.commercio.network/proposals/

When the upgrade proposal passed, the chain will halt at the height indicated in the proposal.

You can verify the approximate date when the upgrade will be performed replacing the height in the following link

https://mainnet.commercio.network/blocks/detail/{HALT_HEIGHT}

Any validator and any user who has staked their tokens can vote the proposal. After two days of voting, the proposal will close and if it passes, the update will be performed at the proposed height.

You can use the command line interface to vote **Yes**, **No**, **Abstain** or **NoWithVeto**.

```bash
commercionetworkd tx gov vote \
   PROPOSAL_ID \
   yes \
   --from DELEGATOR_WALLET \
   --chain-id commercio-3 \
   --fees 10000ucommercio \
   -y
```

**PROPOSAL_ID** is the id of proposal (in this case 5).    
If you use ledger add `--ledger` flag to the command.


You also can use the web interfaces with keplr support

- [Ping.pub Tesnet Commercio.Network](https://ping.pub/commercio.network/gov)


## Upgrade procedure

Download the repo from GitHub **if you have not already done so**. If you already have the local copy of repository don't try to clone it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/commercionetwork/commercionetwork.git
```

Go to the repo folder, checkout to the `v5.1.0` tag and build the application

```bash
cd commercionetwork
git checkout master
git fetch --tags && git checkout v5.1.0
make build
```

Check that the application is the right version

```bash
./build/commercionetworkd version --long
```

The result should be

```
name: commercionetwork
server_name: commercionetworkd
version: 5.1.0
commit: da3b489683ff6eae7333d324b91b326ccce21429
build_tags: netgo,ledger
go: go version go1.21.6 linux/amd64
build_deps:
- cosmossdk.io/api@v0.2.6
- cosmossdk.io/core@v0.5.1
....
```


### Cosmovisor installation



<img src="../img/attetion.png" width="50">**WARNING**: you need to set up cosmovisor env, mainly `$DAEMON_HOME` variable.<img src="../img/attetion.png" width="50">

In most cases, the value of `$DAEMON_HOME` variable is `$HOME/.commercionetwork`. If you don't have this variable set, you can set it with command below

```bash
export DAEMON_HOME="$HOME/.commercionetwork"
echo "export DAEMON_HOME=\$HOME/.commercionetwork" >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

**From `commercionetwork` repository folder** run commands below


```bash
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5.1.0/bin
cp ./build/commercionetworkd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v5.1.0/bin/.
```

**<img src="../img/attetion.png" width="30">WARNING**: You need to set up backup strategies. If you don't set the `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP` variable, a backup of your `data` folder will be performed before the upgrade. If `data` folder occupies, for example, 60Gb, you will need an equal or greater amount of free space on your disk to perform the backup. Read [here](./setup_cosmovisor.md) how to set up your cosmovisor.   

- Set `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP` to `false` **if you want a backup**
- Set `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP` to `true` **if you DON'T want a backup**


### Generic installation (**WITHOUT COSMOVISOR**)


**<img src="../img/attetion.png" width="30">WARNING**: the path where the executable is installed depends on your environment. In the following, it is indicated with $GOPATH.

Few hours before the upgrade, set up your `commercionetworkd` service by changing the line

```ini
Restart=always
```
to
```ini
#Restart=always
Restart=no
```

Your service file should be in `/etc/systemd/system/commercionetworkd.service`

Reload and restart service
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart commercionetworkd.service
```

Wait monitoring from your logs when your node crashes.

```bash
journalctl -u commercionetworkd.service -f
```

When the node halts you need to change the `commercionetworkd` program and start the service.     
From `commercionetwork` repository folder, run the command below

```bash
cp ./build/commercionetworkd $GOPATH/bin/.
```

If you want to make a backup copy of the `data` folder and save it in a secure place.  

Remember to revert your service configuration

```
#Restart=always
Restart=no
```
to
```
Restart=always
```


Reload and restart the service

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start commercionetworkd.service
```

Check if the service is working

```bash
journalctl -u commercionetworkd.service -f
```

### ON UPGRADE ERROR 

If you run into an error you can ask help on the [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/973149882032468029/973163682030833685)

## After the official release

In the days following the mainnet update, an official version will be released for use in the mainnet.   
The official version may be replaced on the mainnet independently by each node.
